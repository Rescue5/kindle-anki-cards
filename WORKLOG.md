# Agent Work Log

This file is an append-only engineering journal for agents working on the
project. Read it before starting work and append a dated entry after every
logical batch. Do not store secrets or private vocabulary data here.

## 2026-07-11 - Codex - Lifecycle and synchronization redesign started

### Goal

Replace the overloaded entry status model with independent lexeme freshness,
processing, source membership, and destination synchronization states. Preserve
Kindle contexts, integrate Obsidian without replacing the library, and make
connector/process UI states factual.

### Audit

- Reviewed commits `2311f25` and `4e25a5f` and the current ignored runtime cache.
- Confirmed that `processing_status` currently mixes novelty and processing.
- Confirmed that `export_status` is reused for file export and Obsidian sync.
- Confirmed that enabling Obsidian replaces frontend library state before a
  client-side lemma merge, losing reliable provenance.
- Confirmed that the cache merge drops fresh Kindle occurrences when a base form
  already exists.
- Confirmed that a missing Kindle returns cached data without a separate physical
  connection state.
- Confirmed that pipeline progress is timer-driven and cancel only ignores the
  eventual response.

### Decisions

- One library row represents one lemma; forms and contexts are occurrences.
- A lemma is new only until the next successful Kindle synchronization.
- Obsidian-imported cards are known, processed, and synchronized.
- Obsidian content wins on conflicts; Kindle contributes forms and occurrences.
- Offline processing remains a manual action.
- The main Obsidian action synchronizes all eligible pending lexemes, regardless
  of the current table filter.
- This implementation is performed by Codex without subagents, per user request.

### Verification Before Changes

- `npm.cmd run build`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python tests/test_obsidian_sync_smoke.py`: passed.
- `pytest` is not installed in the `kindle_app` conda environment; backend tests
  will use the standard-library `unittest` runner.

### Next

- Introduce catalog schema v2 and migration.
- Replace bridge and frontend contracts.
- Add real progress/cancellation, UI integration, tests, and visual QA.

## 2026-07-11 - Codex - Lifecycle and synchronization redesign implemented

### Backend And Runtime

- Replaced cache v1 entries with catalog v2 lexemes, occurrences, freshness,
  processing, source membership, and independent destination states.
- Added atomic v1 migration with a one-time `.v1.bak` backup and source
  reconciliation from cached Kindle data and configured Obsidian cards.
- Changed Kindle synchronization to preserve known processing while adding new
  forms and contexts. A successful sync advances the novelty batch.
- Changed Obsidian import to merge into the catalog with Obsidian analysis as the
  authority instead of replacing frontend state.
- Added per-lexeme Obsidian outcomes: `added`, `already_present`, `blocked`, and
  `failed`. Existing cards are never overwritten.
- Added optimizer progress callbacks and structured progress events on stderr;
  stdout remains clean bridge JSON.
- Changed the Tauri bridge to stream progress events and terminate the child
  Python process when `cancel_python_bridge(job_id)` is called.
- Improved Obsidian card rendering so the English base form survives round-trip
  parsing for enriched and `NN_PENDING` cards.

### Frontend

- Replaced the old entry contract with `LexemeRecord` and independent connector,
  processing, freshness, source, and destination types.
- Split the former monolithic `src/main.tsx` into a controller hook, pure domain
  selectors, and focused workspace components.
- Removed the bottom-left source card and timer-driven pipeline.
- Added factual Kindle/Obsidian connector controls, five-second focused-window
  probing, combined row states, grouped contexts, global Obsidian sync, and a
  compact operation rail with cancel, retry, and dismiss states.
- Added a real Obsidian enable switch to Settings.
- Added deterministic browser preview scenarios for mixed, disconnected, slow,
  and one-time operation-error states.

### Local Data Migration

- Migrated the ignored local catalog successfully: 1,022 legacy rows became 997
  lexemes without deleting occurrences.
- Reconciliation produced 809 `ready + synced` lexemes and 188
  `pending + not_synced` lexemes.
- Runtime data and its backup remain ignored and are not part of commits.

### Tests And Visual QA

- `python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 8 tests passed.
- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `cargo check`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed; only expected Windows line-ending warnings.
- Browser QA at 1280x720 passed with no console errors and no body overflow.
- Verified filtering, manual processing, global Obsidian sync, disconnected
  Kindle, operation error plus successful retry, cancellation restoring pending
  state, settings navigation, and the Obsidian enable switch.
- Visual polish removed a horizontal table scrollbar, prevented metadata wrapping,
  and improved the narrow inspector's Obsidian status layout.

### Failures Encountered

- `pytest` was unavailable, so backend tests use standard `unittest`.
- Two simultaneous `conda run` commands conflicted over a conda temporary file;
  all conda checks are now run sequentially.
- Vitest dependency installation and execution initially lacked sandbox access;
  both succeeded with the approved external npm cache access.
- PowerShell `Start-Process` inherited duplicate `Path`/`PATH` keys; the local
  Vite server was started through an approved detached Windows process instead.

### Remaining Risk

- Browser preview validates frontend workflows; the Tauri-specific child-process
  cancellation path is covered by Rust compilation and code review, not an
  automated end-to-end WebView test.

## 2026-07-11 - Codex - Redesign finalized

### Commits

- `37d64dd` - work-log protocol and mandatory agent rules.
- `4031d24` - catalog v2, backend lifecycle, progress/cancel bridge, and tests.
- `fc4603b` - React domain/controller/component refactor and Vitest coverage.

### Final Verification

- Re-ran the production frontend build after the final controller and retry
  changes: passed.
- Final Browser screenshots cover a mixed Kindle/Obsidian library with an
  inspected processed lemma and a disconnected Kindle with cached data retained.
- Final console error/warning collection was empty.
- `.kimi-code/`, `.vscode/`, generated screenshots, runtime cache, migration
  backup, logs, and user dictionary data were intentionally left untracked.

## 2026-07-11 - Kimi - Fix Kindle connector flicker and bridge `sync_id` crash

### Goal

Fix two regressions reported after the Codex redesign:

1. The Kindle connector button lost its glow and the disconnected notice flashed
   during every background probe, even when the Kindle was still connected.
2. Offline processing failed with `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'sync_id'`.

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`: removed duplicated `process_lexemes`,
  `export`, and `load_demo` branches left over from the redesign merge. The
  remaining `process_lexemes`/`optimize` handler is the correct one and no
  longer references the undefined `sync_id` or `source.label` variables.
- `src/features/library/use-library-controller.ts`: stopped setting the Kindle
  connector state to `checking` during `probeConnectors`; the previous connected
  state is now preserved until the probe returns a new factual state.
- `src/features/library/library-workspace.tsx`:
  - `ConnectorNotice` now renders only when the Kindle state is `disconnected`,
    so it no longer appears during checks or errors.
  - `ConnectorButton` no longer uses the `checking` state for a spinner, since
    probing no longer transitions to that state.

### Verification

- `python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 8 tests passed.
- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `cargo check`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### Remaining Risk

- Visual QA was limited to a successful production build and TypeScript checks;
  a live browser/Tauri screenshot was not captured because no browser automation
  tooling was installed in the current environment.

## 2026-07-11 - Kimi - Fix `process_lexemes` tuple handling and add bridge smoke test

### Goal

Fix the follow-up regression `'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'` during offline
processing and add a focused smoke test for the bridge `process_lexemes` path.

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`: in the `process_lexemes`/`optimize`
  handler, unpacked the tuple returned by `_analysis_by_lemma` into
  `(analyses, analyses_by_id)` and restored the lookup by representative entry id.
- `tests/test_tauri_bridge_smoke.py`: added a new test module covering:
  - `_analysis_by_lemma` returning a `(by_lemma, by_id)` tuple;
  - `dispatch("process_lexemes", ...)` running end-to-end without crashing on
    the tuple return value.
- `.kimi-code/AGENTS.md`: added a "Mandatory verification after every code change"
  section requiring runtime checks, not just static checks, before reporting
  completion.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 10 tests
  passed (including 2 new bridge smoke tests).
- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `cargo check`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### Remaining Risk

- The new smoke test exercises the happy path; it does not cover all failure
  modes of the optimizer or cancellation edge cases.

## 2026-07-11 - Codex - Recover skipped offline analyses and verify Obsidian state

### Goal

Resolve the remaining bridge error `Не найден audit-файл offline-обработки` and
verify that catalog synchronization marks agree with the configured Obsidian
cards without writing to the vault.

### Changes

- Corrected `process_lexemes` to look up optimizer results by the optimizer's
  normalized candidate key, not only by the display form stored in the catalog.
  This recovers previously processed forms such as an inflected word whose
  audit/snapshot belongs to its base form.
- Treated entries for which the English offline optimizer cannot form a
  candidate as an explicit `rejected` result with the
  `unsupported_language` reason. They no longer report a missing audit file.
- Normalized Obsidian queue reasons from the independent processing state:
  `ready` entries are ready to sync, while rejected and failed entries retain a
  factual blocking reason.
- Added bridge regression coverage for both normalized snapshot recovery and
  unsupported-language rejection.

### Verification

- Re-ran the actual pending-failure batch after the fix: no lexemes remain in
  the `failed` processing state; the unsupported entry is correctly rejected.
- Read-only reconciliation check found 809 catalog entries marked as synced and
  809 matching normalized lemmas in the configured Obsidian cards; there were
  zero catalog entries falsely marked as synced.
- The remaining Obsidian queue consists of ready entries awaiting sync and
  rejected entries with explicit blocking reasons. No vault files were written
  during this verification.

## 2026-07-12 - Kimi - Step 1: async python_bridge with spawn_blocking

### Goal

Make the Tauri `python_bridge` command asynchronous and offload the blocking
Python child-process wait to `tauri::async_runtime::spawn_blocking`, preventing
the Tauri main/UI thread from blocking during backend calls.

### Changes

- `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:
  - Converted `python_bridge` to `async fn` while preserving its
    `Result<Value, String>` frontend contract.
  - Wrapped the managed `OperationState` in `Arc<OperationState>` so it can be
    cloned into the async task and its Drop guard.
  - Added `CancellationTokenGuard` to guarantee removal of the cancellation
    token from `OperationState` even if `spawn_blocking` panics or returns an
    error.
  - Changed `run_python_bridge` to accept `Arc<AtomicBool>` instead of
    `&AtomicBool` for `'static` use inside `spawn_blocking`.
  - Kept `cancel_python_bridge` synchronous and kept the JSON contract and
    progress event emission logic unchanged.

### Verification

- `cargo check` inside `src-tauri`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed (1,996 modules transformed).

### Remaining Risk

- The change compiles and builds, but the actual WebView→Rust→Python latency
  improvement was not measured with a running Tauri app in this step.
- Concurrent cancellation during a blocking backend call is logically preserved,
  but not exercised by an automated end-to-end test yet.

## 2026-07-12 - Kimi - Step 2: avoid heavy reconciliation on read-only library loads

### Goal

Stop re-reconciling Kindle and Obsidian data on every `load_library`/`load_cached`
call. Heavy reconciliation should only happen during explicit actions that mutate
the catalog.

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`:
  - Added `reconcile_obsidian: bool = True` to `_load_catalog_with_sources` while
    keeping the existing `reconcile_kindle: bool = True` default.
  - Changed `load_library`/`load_cached` to call with both reconciliation flags
    set to `False`.
  - Changed `sync_kindle`/`scan`, `process_lexemes`/`optimize`, `export`,
    `load_obsidian`, and `sync_obsidian` to call with both flags set to `False`;
    these handlers apply their own targeted Kindle/Obsidian updates afterwards.
  - No response shapes or other logic were changed.

### Verification

- `python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 11 tests
  passed.
- The base-env run failed only because the `wordfreq` dependency is not installed
  outside the `kindle_app` conda environment; this is environmental, not a code
  regression.

### Remaining Risk

- `load_obsidian` now goes through `_load_catalog_with_sources` (which saves the
  catalog and refreshes destination states) before applying its own Obsidian
  merge. This matches the new contract but adds a small amount of redundant I/O
  compared to the previous direct `vocab_cache.load` call.

## 2026-07-12 - Kimi - Frontend performance fix Steps 3–6

### Goal

Reduce React re-renders, debounce search input, remove forced layout in the
operation rail, reduce connector probing frequency, and virtualize the lexeme
table.

### Changes

- `src/features/library/use-library-controller.ts`:
  - Replaced `React.useDeferredValue(query)` with an explicit `debouncedQuery`
    state updated via `setTimeout(..., 180)` and cleared on unmount/query
    change. The controlled `<Input>` still uses `query`; filtering uses
    `debouncedQuery`.
  - Increased the `connector_status` probe interval from 5 s to 30 s.
  - Added a `lastProbedAt` ref that skips interval/focus probes occurring
    sooner than 30 s after the previous probe. Explicit probes (e.g. after a
    Kindle sync) still run immediately via a new `force` argument.
  - Wrapped the returned controller object in `React.useMemo` with all
    primitives, derived values, and callbacks as dependencies, giving
    `LibraryWorkspace`'s `React.memo` a stable reference.

- `src/features/library/library-workspace.tsx`:
  - Removed the `layout` prop from `motion.section` in `OperationRail`; the
    `AnimatePresence` height animation remains.
  - Virtualized `LexemeTable`: tracks `scrollTop`/`clientHeight` of the scroll
    container, renders an overscan slice (±5 rows) with spacer rows before and
    after, and scrolls the selected row into view when it leaves the visible
    window. `LexemeRow` and its `React.memo` are unchanged.

### Verification

- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `git diff --check`: passed (only expected Windows line-ending warnings).

### Remaining Risk

- The virtualized list assumes a fixed 48 px row height. Rows with unusually
    long lemmata or contexts could grow slightly, causing minor scroll drift;
    visual QA on a large real library is recommended.
- Connector probes are now spaced 30 s apart; users connecting/disconnecting a
    Kindle between probes will see the state update only on the next scheduled
    probe or an explicit sync action.

## 2026-07-12 - Kimi - Integrated performance fixes

### Goal

Integrate the async Tauri bridge, Python reconciliation flags, and frontend
performance improvements, then verify the combined change.

### Integration

- Reviewed the three parallel coder outputs (Rust async bridge, Python reconcile
  flags, frontend memoization/virtualization).
- Confirmed no overlapping file edits and no JSON contract changes.
- Verified that `CancellationTokenGuard` removes the token even if the blocking
  task panics.
- Confirmed `_load_catalog_with_sources` defaults remain backward-compatible.
- Checked that the virtualized table preserves grid columns and scrolls selected
  rows into view.

### Verification

- `cargo check` inside `src-tauri`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 11 tests
  passed.
- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `git diff --check`: passed (only expected Windows line-ending warnings).

### Remaining Risk

- Real-world Tauri UI smoothness (window move/resize during heavy operations)
  was not measured in this environment because no live WebView profiling tool
  is available here.
- Visual QA of the virtualized table with a very large library is recommended.

## 2026-07-13 - Kimi - Backend: restore skipped snapshot state and report skip count

### Goal

Fix the backend part of three reported issues:
1. Provide a stable Kindle connection signature for frontend auto-sync detection.
2. Restore `ready` processing state for lexemes already present in the processed snapshot when the catalog loads.
3. Include the `skipped_existing` count in the offline-processing completion message so the UI can explain the numbers.

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`:
  - `_connector_status` now returns `signature` for a connected Kindle source using `source.signature` from `find_kindle_source()`.
  - `_load_catalog_with_sources` now calls `_restore_ready_from_snapshot` after reconciliation and before saving. Pending lexemes whose normalized `lemma`, `display_form`, or any `form` matches a key in `.app-data/optimized/processed_snapshot.json` are marked `ready` with an analysis built by `_analysis_from_snapshot`.
  - Added helpers `_restore_ready_from_snapshot` and `_lexeme_snapshot_keys`.
  - The `process_lexemes`/`optimize` completion event message is now in Russian and includes the `skipped_existing` count: "Обработано: N; принято: N; отклонено: N; пропущено ранее: M".

- `tests/test_tauri_bridge_smoke.py`:
  - Replaced the old `test_process_lexemes_recovers_snapshot_using_normalized_candidate_key` with `test_load_catalog_restores_ready_state_from_snapshot`, which verifies the new catalog-load restore path.
  - Added `test_process_lexemes_message_includes_skipped_existing_in_russian` to assert the Russian message and skip count.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 12 tests passed.

### Remaining Risk

- The snapshot restore only matches by normalized lemma/forms; lexemes whose processed snapshot key differs from all stored forms will remain pending until reprocessed.
- The new `signature` field in `_connector_status` is only present when a Kindle source is actually connected; the frontend must handle its absence on disconnected/unknown states.
- Full cross-layer verification (npm test, npm run build, cargo check) is left to the integration pass.

## 2026-07-13 - Kimi - Frontend auto-sync, table virtualization, and integration

### Goal

Complete the frontend and integration parts of the three reported issues:
1. Auto-sync Kindle when the connector probe detects a new connection or device signature.
2. Fix the virtualized lexeme table so it renders all visible rows on first mount.
3. Wire the backend's Russian skip-count message through to the UI and verify the full stack.

### Changes

- `src/types.ts`:
  - Added optional `signature?: string[]` to `ConnectorInfo`.

- `src/lib/backend.ts`:
  - `mockConnectors` now returns a stable `signature` for the connected Kindle preview source.

- `src/features/library/use-library-controller.ts`:
  - Added `prevConnectorsRef`, `lastAutoSyncSignatureRef`, and `syncKindleRef`.
  - `probeConnectors` now compares the current Kindle state/signature with the previous probe and triggers `syncKindle` only on a genuine transition to `connected` or when a new signature appears, skipping duplicates and avoiding loops.
  - `syncKindle` records the synced signature so the next probe does not re-trigger.
  - `processVisible` now uses the backend's `message` if present and falls back to a Russian message that includes `skipped_existing`.

- `src/features/library/library-workspace.tsx`:
  - Replaced the post-mount viewport measurement with a callback ref that reads `clientHeight` synchronously when the scroll container is attached.
  - Added a `ResizeObserver` to keep `viewportHeight` accurate on resize.
  - Removed the mutable `containerRef` in favor of a `container` state variable, avoiding TypeScript readonly-ref issues.

- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`:
  - Added a top-level `message` field to the `process_lexemes`/`optimize` response containing the same Russian skip-count text already used in the event array.

### Verification

- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 12 tests passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed (only expected Windows line-ending warning for `WORKLOG.md`).

### Remaining Risk

- Auto-sync is gated by the 30-second probe interval; a Kindle connected and disconnected within that window may be missed.
- The virtualized table still assumes a fixed 48 px row height; unusually long content could cause minor scroll drift on very large libraries.
- Live browser/Tauri screenshot QA was not performed in this environment.

## 2026-07-13 - Kimi - Integration: auto-sync, table virtualization, and snapshot restore

### Goal

Integrate and verify the three reported fixes across frontend, backend, and contracts:
1. Automatic Kindle sync when the device is connected or its signature changes.
2. Virtualized lexeme table renders all visible rows on first paint.
3. Processed-snapshot lexemes are restored to ready state and the skip count is reported in the UI.

### Changes

- `src/types.ts`: added optional `signature?: string[]` to `ConnectorInfo`.
- `src/lib/backend.ts`: mock backend connector status now returns a stable `signature` for the Kindle preview source.
- `src/features/library/use-library-controller.ts`:
  - Tracks the previous connector status and the last auto-synced Kindle signature in refs.
  - `probeConnectors` triggers `syncKindle` only on a genuine transition to `connected` or when the signature changes, avoiding duplicate syncs and loops.
  - `processVisible` now includes `skipped_existing` in the completion message shown in the operation rail.
- `src/features/library/library-workspace.tsx`: fixed the virtualized table initial render by measuring the scroll container through a callback ref and `ResizeObserver`, so `viewportHeight` is never stuck at 0.
- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`: already updated by the backend pass; verified that `_connector_status` returns `signature`, `_load_catalog_with_sources` restores snapshot state, and the completion event reports `skipped_existing` in Russian.
- `tests/test_tauri_bridge_smoke.py`: already updated by the backend pass; tests pass.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 12 tests passed.
- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed (only expected Windows line-ending warning for `WORKLOG.md`).

### Remaining Risk

- The snapshot restore currently marks every matched lexeme as `ready`, even if the snapshot entry was originally rejected (`accepted: false`). The analysis object preserves the correct `accepted` value, but the UI state does not reflect rejection. This matches the current instruction to set state to `ready`, but may need refinement if rejected snapshot entries exist in the wild.
- First-render auto-sync may trigger an immediate `sync_kindle` when a Kindle is already connected at app startup; this is intentional but could surprise users who expected the app to stay on the cached library.
- Real-world Tauri end-to-end verification (actual USB Kindle connection, auto-sync timing, and large-library table scrolling) was not performed in this environment.

## 2026-07-13 - Kimi - Refine snapshot restore for rejected entries

### Goal

Ensure that lexemes restored from the processed snapshot reflect their original
acceptance status instead of always appearing as `ready`.

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`: `_restore_ready_from_snapshot` now sets
  `processing.state` to `rejected` when the snapshot entry has `accepted: false`.
- `tests/test_tauri_bridge_smoke.py`: added
  `test_load_catalog_restores_rejected_state_from_snapshot` to cover the
  rejected-restore path.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 13 tests
  passed.
- `npm test`: 3 Vitest tests passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`:
  passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed (only expected Windows line-ending warnings).

### Remaining Risk

- Live USB Kindle auto-sync timing and large-library table virtualization were
  not verified in this environment.

## 2026-07-13 - Codex - Passive Kindle presence probing

### Goal

Keep automatic Kindle synchronization while preventing periodic connector
checks from browsing device storage or opening `vocab.db`.

### Changes

- Added a lightweight `KindlePresence` detector that checks only top-level
  devices shown by Windows under "This PC". Mounted-volume fallback checks the
  volume identity but does not search folders.
- `connector_status` now uses the passive detector. Full MTP/path traversal and
  copying remain confined to `sync_kindle`.
- Connector polling is limited to once per minute, overlapping probes are
  suppressed, and failed automatic synchronization retries use a five-minute
  backoff.
- Added Python and Vitest coverage for the passive boundary and retry policy.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 16 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `npm test`: 6 passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed with expected Windows line-ending warnings.

### Device Safety

- Background probes do not enumerate Kindle folders or copy files.
- Synchronization copies `vocab.db` from Kindle to a local staging/cache path;
  the application never writes, renames, or deletes files on the device.
- A live passive probe reported the device as disconnected at verification
  time, so the connected-device path remains covered by mocks rather than a
  physical Kindle test.

## 2026-07-14 - Codex - SQLite library and one-way Obsidian sync

### Goal

Replace competing JSON state files with one durable SQLite library, process new
Kindle lexemes through a resumable queue, and make Obsidian a verified one-way
destination rather than a source of vocabulary state.

### Decisions

- `.app-data/kindle_cards.sqlite3` is the authoritative application store.
  Legacy catalog and snapshot JSON files are imported once and backed up, but
  are no longer written by the application bridge.
- Lexemes are unique by language and canonical key; forms and Kindle contexts
  remain separate records, and context fingerprints prevent duplicate imports.
- Queue items are committed one lexeme at a time. Accepted and rejected terminal
  states are both durable and are not reanalysed when another form or context is
  discovered.
- Obsidian is read only for reconciliation. A sync rereads the vault, backs it
  up, appends eligible cards, verifies the result, and only then records a
  destination as synced.
- Rejected lexemes remain visible under `Все`, but are excluded from `Новые`
  and `Не в Obsidian`.

### Changes

- Added the versioned SQLite repository, migration, repository-level queue,
  analysis, destination, and sync-run persistence.
- Moved bridge loading, Kindle sync, processing, export state, and Obsidian
  reconciliation to the repository. Added `process_queue` while preserving the
  explicit `process_lexemes` compatibility action.
- Hardened Obsidian append-only writes with exact prefix verification and
  duplicate-lemma blocking inside a single sync batch.
- Replaced the normal manual processing control with compact automatic queue
  status and retry-on-error behavior. Fixed automatic queue resumption after a
  Kindle operation completed.
- Updated frontend contracts, filters, preview fixtures, project documentation,
  and focused Python/Vitest coverage.

### Local Migration Audit

- Imported 1,039 canonical lexemes and 1,332 non-Obsidian occurrences.
- Preserved 1,023 ready and 16 rejected states; the persistent queue is empty.
- Reconciliation reports 1,022 synced, 16 not applicable, and 1 missing
  Obsidian destination, repairing the previously stale synced state.
- SQLite integrity check passed, foreign-key violations are zero, and both
  legacy JSON backup files exist.
- No Obsidian write was performed during the audit.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 21 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m compileall -q kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `npm test -- --run`: 8 passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 1,996 modules transformed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app cargo check -q --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`:
  passed.
- Bridge `load_library` smoke: 1,039 entries, zero pending/failed queue items.
- Chromium QA at 1,440 x 900 confirmed automatic queue completion, accepted-only
  `Новые`, eligible-only `Не в Obsidian`, bounded table scrolling, and zero
  console errors or warnings.
- `git diff --check`: passed with expected Windows line-ending warnings.

### Remaining Risk

- A physical Kindle was not connected during the final end-to-end run, so the
  new SQLite path is covered by repository/bridge tests and the existing mocked
  device boundary rather than a live USB sync.
- The standalone optimizer CLI intentionally retains snapshot compatibility;
  application runtime state is SQLite-only.

## 2026-09-29 - Codex - Initialize macOS development workspace

### Goal

Initialize this local workspace from `git@github.com:Rescue5/kindle_app.git` and
install the documented development environment.

### Changes

- Configured `origin` and checked out `main` at `1a0d815`, tracking
  `origin/main`.
- Ran `scripts/setup-dev.sh`, creating the `kindle_app` conda environment and
  installing the Python package, npm dependencies, and NLTK resources.
- No application source files were changed.

### Verification

- `kindle-vocab-doctor`: all checks passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app npm run build`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 21 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app npm test`: 8 passed.

### Remaining Risk

- npm reported 6 dependency advisories (3 moderate, 3 high) during installation;
  dependencies were not changed beyond the committed lockfile.

## 2026-09-29 - Codex Review backend subagent - Durable review queue

### Goal

Add a small offline review loop for accepted vocabulary without changing Kindle processing or inventing translations.

### Changes

- Added SQLite schema v2 with per-lexeme review schedule and ratings.
- Added `load_review` and `rate_review` bridge actions. Due cards contain stored analysis and Kindle occurrences; rejected words are excluded.
- Preserved review progress across full catalog replacements used by Kindle and Obsidian synchronization.
- Added focused tests for eligibility, rating intervals, persistence, migration from schema v1, bridge actions, and invalid requests.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 25 passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### Remaining Risk

- The scheduling rules are intentionally basic: again after 10 minutes, hard after at least 1 day, and good after at least 3 days. No long-term retention model or daily new-card limit is implemented.

## 2026-09-29 - Codex subagent - Books and Insights views

### Goal

Add book and reading-insight screens using only the existing `BookOption`,
`LexemeRecord`, and occurrence data.

### Decisions And Changes

- Added `src/features/reading/reading-domain.ts` for book grouping, validated
  date keys, daily activity, and repeat counts.
- Added `src/features/reading/books-view.tsx` with a searchable book shelf,
  selected-book summary, word search, repeat filter, and word-open callback.
- Added `src/features/reading/insights-view.tsx` with factual vocabulary,
  occurrence, book, repeat, and dated activity summaries.
- No reading progress, chapter position, or reading speed is inferred.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed before this log append.

### Remaining Risk

- These new views are not yet connected to the application navigation in this
  independent work lane. Visual QA belongs to the integration pass after the
  parent wires the screens into the running app.

## 2026-09-29 - Codex - Reading companion interface integrated

### Goal

Turn the utility-focused desktop workspace into a reading vocabulary companion
with a useful home, books, words, review, and insights flow.

### Decisions And Changes

- Created a literary light visual direction and implemented the new navigation,
  home, review card UI, compact background status, and responsive layouts.
- Connected Books and Insights to real saved Kindle occurrences. The home uses
  the latest recorded book, and never invents reading progress or book covers.
- Kept export inside Words and moved processing out of navigation. Added a
  shortcut to review newly found words with the existing New filter.
- Improved the word inspector with its saved context and available translation
  first, plus a calmer treatment of technical analysis and Obsidian state.
- Added browser-preview review actions and focused tests for book grouping,
  activity dates, repeat counts, and Russian count forms.
- Replaced the mismatched app icon with a matching SVG source and PNG/ICO/ICNS
  variants. Added the missing PNG required by Tauri's macOS build context.
- Updated README and architecture notes for the new UI and Review actions.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app npm run build`: passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app npm test`: 10 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 25 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app cargo check -q --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`:
  passed after adding the missing icon.
- In-app browser QA covered Home, book selection, book-to-word navigation,
  review reveal and rating, Insights, and Settings. Reviewed desktop, the
  normal browser window, and a 390 px mobile viewport; no horizontal document
  overflow or console warnings/errors were observed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### Remaining Risk

- Browser QA used sample data. A live Kindle and the full Tauri WebView workflow
  were not exercised here.
- Review scheduling is intentionally simple; AI explanations and reading
  progress are omitted because the current data cannot support them reliably.

## 2026-09-30 - Codex MTP test subagent - Sync audit and macOS MTP coverage

### Goal

Review existing Kindle synchronization for idempotency and add focused tests for the new macOS MTP adapter without accessing personal vocabulary contents.

### Findings

- SQLite library changes occur only after device copy, database validation, and entry extraction. A transfer failure leaves the library intact.
- Existing mounted-path and Windows MTP copy helpers replace the cached `vocab.db` before SQLite validation; the macOS adapter instead validates its staging copy before replacement.
- Occurrence identity currently uses word, context, book, and date; duplicate lookups with the same values on one day may be counted once. This affects repeated-lookup metrics but does not duplicate processing of known lexemes.

### Changes

- Added `tests/test_kindle_mtp.py` with synthetic USB trees, fake MTP sessions, and temporary SQLite fixtures. Tests cover passive detection, Kindle-only device selection, worker timeout and malformed JSON, incomplete transfer preserving the previous cache, validated cache replacement, and thumbnail path restrictions.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest tests.test_kindle_mtp -v`: 6 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 36 passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### Remaining Risk

- The native Kalam ABI and a live USB transfer require separate integration verification; these tests do not open a physical Kindle.

## 2026-09-30 - Codex subagent - Book cover cache and reading UI

### Goal

Show genuine Kindle or Open Library book covers in Home and Books, with a local
cache and a manual Books action to fetch missing covers.

### Decisions And Changes

- Added `kindle_vocab_app/book_covers.py` with `attach_covers`,
  `prefer_local_covers`, and `download_covers`. Kindle portrait thumbnails are
  matched by an ASIN present in the book key and take priority. Open Library
  search uses exact normalized title and author matches, then downloads a
  medium JPEG by Cover ID. Ambiguous works are skipped.
- Limited Open Library requests to HTTPS trusted hosts, bounded response sizes
  and timeouts, and at most 40 new searches per run. Missing results are cached
  for 30 days and transient errors for six hours. Per-book errors are contained.
- Added optional book title, author, cover data URL, and cover status to the
  frontend contract. Home and Books render cached real images and retain the
  typographic fallback. Books has a manual cover-download button with a busy
  state and available-count display.
- Added seven isolated tests using synthetic book data and mocked network
  responses; no user vocabulary database or runtime cover files were read.
- API contract checked against the official Open Library Search and Covers API
  documentation.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest tests.test_book_covers -v`: 7 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app npm run build`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed before this log append.

### Remaining Risk

- Bridge/controller wiring and the real Kindle-thumbnail copy are handled by
  the integration lane. A live cover download and final Tauri visual pass were
  not performed in this isolated lane.

## 2026-09-30 - Codex occurrence identity subagent - Preserve distinct Kindle lookups

### Goal

Keep each Kindle lookup distinct while avoiding duplicate occurrences when an existing content-hash catalog is synchronized again with stable Kindle lookup IDs.

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/vocab_cache.py`: Kindle entries with a `lookup_id` now use SHA1 of `kindle|lookup-id|<id>` as the occurrence ID. Entries without a lookup ID retain the previous content-hash behavior.
- Before adding an ID-backed lookup, the merge removes only matching legacy Kindle content-hash occurrences calculated with the full timestamp or the earlier date-only timestamp. Existing ID-backed occurrences are left intact.
- `tests/test_vocab_catalog.py`: added identical-content distinct-ID and repeated-sync checks, plus transition checks for both legacy hash variants.
- `tests/test_kindle_mtp.py`: updated the synthetic MTP session to allow optional root listing for device metadata.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest tests.test_vocab_catalog -v`: 6 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 40 passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

### Remaining Risk

- A live repeat sync after the current queue finishes is still needed to confirm aggregate lookup counts against the connected Kindle. No personal vocabulary contents were inspected for this change.

## 2026-09-30 - Codex subagent - Recover real book-cover matches

### Goal

Improve cover matching after the first live Kindle synchronization returned no
covers for books whose metadata included file provenance or series decorations.

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/book_covers.py` now strips only recognized trailing source,
  author, copy-number, and series markers for search/display. It preserves the
  original Kindle title in application occurrences. Author matching handles
  reversed names and missing spaces, and title matching treats apostrophes
  consistently.
- Added a bounded second title candidate only when a numbered series prefix
  overlaps the true title. A broad Open Library query can recover punctuation
  variants, but the returned title and author still need exact normalized
  matching and a unique work.
- Local Kindle thumbnail matching accepts an explicit `asin` field when book
  keys are UUIDs. Negative cache entries carry `search_version`; old misses are
  retried without deleting cache files. Manual calls can use
  `retry_errors=True` to retry transient failures.
- Accepted HTTPS redirects from the Open Library Covers API to `archive.org`
  and strict `*.us.archive.org` hosts. Initial requests remain limited to
  Open Library; response host, JPEG type, size, and timeouts are checked.
- Expanded synthetic tests for cleanup, strict matching, local ASIN matching,
  negative-cache refresh, manual retry, and trusted/untrusted redirects.

### Verification

- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest tests.test_book_covers -v`: 17 passed.
- `conda run -n kindle_app python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 50 passed.
- A read-only search for several public titles found exact Cover IDs; one
  full HTTPS search and JPEG download into a temporary test directory returned
  `downloaded=1` and `cover_status=available`.

### Remaining Risk

- Some books may have no exact Open Library work with a cover. They keep the
  typographic fallback rather than receiving a guessed image. The integration
  lane must pass `retry_errors=True` for the manual Books action.

## 2026-09-30 - Codex - Live macOS Kindle synchronization and covers

### Goal

Read the user's connected USB Kindle, add macOS MTP support and genuine cached
book covers, and verify synchronization against the physical device.

### Decisions And Changes

- Identified an Amazon Kindle over USB MTP rather than a mounted volume.
  Downloaded OpenMTP 3.3.0 for Apple Silicon from its official GitHub release,
  verified its Developer ID and notarization with macOS, and installed it in
  Applications. No additional global package manager was installed.
- Added a read-only Kalam adapter in `kindle_mtp.py`. Native transfers run in a
  bounded subprocess with a local exclusive lock, Kindle identity verification,
  fixed source paths, staged SQLite validation, and atomic cache replacement.
  Passive device polling reads USB identity without opening Kindle storage.
- Connected the adapter through `kindle_device.py`. Preserved the existing
  mounted-volume and Windows MTP paths. No files were written to the Kindle.
- Integrated cached ASIN metadata and local Kindle thumbnails with the cover
  service. Connected automatic cover fetching after Kindle sync, manual Books
  downloads, transient-error retry, offline cache reads, counts, and UI states.
  Added cleaned shelf titles while preserving original occurrence metadata.
- Retained full Kindle timestamps and stable lookup IDs. Compatibility migration
  now preserves distinct identical lookups and avoids duplicating older hashes.
- Updated README and architecture/action notes. All personal databases, images,
  local backups, and optimizer outputs remain under ignored app data.

### Verification

- Live transfer copied a validated Vocabulary Builder database and 61 nonempty
  portrait thumbnails. The library contains 1,760 canonical lexemes, 2,522
  distinct lookups, and 7 books after deterministic processing and consolidation.
- Initial queue processing completed. Repeated live synchronization left the
  queue empty; a subsequent processing call processed zero new lexemes.
- Six of seven books have real cached covers: one matched Kindle thumbnail and
  five Open Library downloads. The unmatched book retains a typographic jacket.
- Fixed two concrete integration failures: `ioreg` needs `-l` to include USB
  identity properties in its plist, and Covers API image redirects use the
  Internet Archive HTTPS hosts. Both now have focused coverage.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 50 passed.
- `npm test`: 10 passed. TypeScript/Vite build and a macOS debug app bundle built
  successfully using `npm run tauri build -- --debug --bundles app`.
- Launched the actual bundled Tauri app with the workspace Python runtime.
  Reviewed the Books screen screenshot with real cached covers and aggregate
  counts; invoked the cover-download button and verified the bridge action.
- `git diff --check`: passed. Personal app data is ignored by Git.

### Remaining Limits

- One book has no exact cover match; no substitute image was guessed.
- macOS became locked after the successful Books visual pass, so an additional
  Home screenshot was unavailable. The final UI build is verified by compilation.
- The debug app still uses the project's Python runtime; distributing a fully
  self-contained desktop package is separate work. Close OpenMTP while Kindle
  Cards owns the MTP connection.

## 2026-10-30 - Claude - Read-only project audit

### Goal

Study the current architecture and state after the SQLite redesign. No source
files were changed.

### Findings

- Library state: 1,158 lexemes (1,142 ready, 16 rejected), empty queue;
  Obsidian destinations: 1,022 synced, 120 missing, 16 not applicable.
- `save_catalog` rewrites every table (`DELETE FROM lexemes` + reinsert) and
  `load_catalog` issues several queries per lexeme; acceptable at ~1k lexemes.
- `vocab_cache._merge_entry` scans the whole catalog per Kindle entry (quadratic
  sync merge).
- `_process_queued_lexemes` re-raises on the first failure; a deterministically
  failing lexeme stays first in the `failed` queue and blocks the rest on retry.
  The frontend also pauses auto-processing while the last operation is `error`.
- Unused bridge helpers remain: `_entry_updates_from_analysis`,
  `missing_kindle_state`, `load_database_state`; `_analysis_by_lemma` is only
  referenced by a test.
- Obsidian lemma normalization (`_normalize_base`) differs slightly from
  `vocab_cache.normalize_lemma`.
- The Rust bridge spawns Python without a no-console-window flag and the binary
  has no `windows_subsystem` attribute; release builds may show console windows.

### Verification

- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 21 passed.
- `python -m compileall -q kindle_vocab_app`: passed.
- `npm test`: 8 passed. `npm run build`: passed. `cargo check`: passed.
- Bridge `load_library` ~0.4 s, `connector_status` ~0.5 s (Kindle disconnected).
- Note: `conda run` does not forward stdin; bridge smoke checks must call the
  env's `python.exe` directly.

## 2026-10-30 - Claude - Processing queue no longer stalls on a failed lexeme

### Goal

Fix the audit finding that one deterministically failing lexeme blocked the
whole offline-processing queue.

### Decisions

- A per-lexeme analysis failure is recorded durably as `failed` and the run
  continues; storage errors still propagate.
- The automatic `process_queue` handles only `pending` items. Failed items are
  retried only with `include_failed: true` (Retry in the operation rail or the
  new header button). Explicit `process_lexemes` still includes failed ids.
- Queue order is pending first, then failed, each by `created_at`.
- Auto-processing pauses only after a failed/cancelled processing run, not after
  unrelated operation errors (for example a disconnected Kindle).

### Changes

- `kindle_vocab_app/library_repository.py`: `queued_ids(..., include_failed=)`
  with pending-first ordering.
- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py`: continue after per-lexeme failures, new
  `failed_new` response field, `ошибок: N` in the completion message,
  `include_failed` payload flag.
- `src/features/library/domain.ts`: pure `shouldAutoProcessQueue` policy.
- `src/features/library/use-library-controller.ts`: auto-run via the policy,
  `retryFailed`, partial failures surface as an error operation with Retry.
- `src/features/library/library-workspace.tsx`: header "Ошибки: N" retry button
  when failed lexemes exist and nothing is running.
- `src/lib/backend.ts`: mock respects `include_failed`, reports failed queue
  items, and adds `?scenario=lexeme-failure` for preview QA.
- Tests: replaced the old "stop on first failure" bridge test with continue,
  retry-on-request, and pending-first ordering tests; added Vitest policy tests.

### Verification

- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`: 23 passed.
- `npm test`: 13 passed. `npm run build`: passed.
- Browser QA at 1440x900 with `?scenario=lexeme-failure`: the queue processed
  the remaining lexemes, showed the partial-failure rail and header button,
  did not loop automatically; dismiss + header retry processed the failed
  lexeme; no console errors.

### Remaining Risk

- No Rust changes, so `cargo check` was not re-run. The real Tauri path was not
  exercised end to end; behaviour is covered by bridge tests and the mock.

## 2026-10-30 - Claude - Product direction agreed with the user

### Decisions

- Goal: turn the personal tool into a product another person can install and
  use; possible modest demand.
- First audience: Russian-speaking readers of English books on Kindle.
- Contextual meaning/translation via the user's own API key (OpenAI-compatible
  providers and Anthropic). Offline mode stays honest: no fabricated fields.
- Outputs: Anki (direct deck via AnkiConnect and `.apkg`) and Obsidian with a
  configurable, non-personal format. Built-in spaced repetition (FSRS) is
  deferred to a later phase as a complement to Anki, not a replacement.

### Proposed Phases

1. Card value: contextual LLM enrichment, direct Anki export, generalized
   Obsidian format.
2. Shippable: single installer (Python sidecar), data in the OS app-data
   directory, first-run onboarding, manual `vocab.db` selection.
3. Product: English UI, auto-update, code signing, landing page, optional
   in-app review.

No code changes in this entry.

## 2026-10-30 - Claude - Tooling setup and macOS work integration

### Goal

Prepare for sustained product development and open-source promotion, and
bring the local Windows branch up to date with work pushed from macOS.

### Tooling

- Installed into the `kindle_app` env: `pytest`, `ruff`, `genanki`.
- Installed GitHub CLI; it still needs `gh auth login` by the owner.
- Installed a reviewed subset of MIT-licensed marketing skills
  (coreyhaines31/marketingskills) at user level, not in this repository.
- Offered official Claude Code plugins (feature-dev, pr-review-toolkit,
  code-simplifier, security-guidance, github) via the plugin catalog.

### Integration

- `origin/main` contained `59ac6de` (reading companion UI, review queue,
  covers, macOS MTP) that diverged from the local queue fix. Merged with
  `--no-ff`; resolved `WORKLOG.md` (both sides kept, chronological) and the
  controller (covers + failed-lexeme retry both kept).
- On Windows, `59ac6de` already failed 6 tests: `with sqlite3.connect()` does
  not close the handle, so the Kindle `vocab.db` stayed locked.
  `kindle_db._connect` now closes its connection; tests use `closing()`.
- The macOS-only MTP worker test is skipped on Windows (`fcntl`).
- `tests/conftest.py` ignores temp-dir cleanup errors on Windows, where
  scanners briefly hold new files after assertions pass.

### Verification

- `pytest`: 51 passed, 1 skipped, stable across 4 runs.
- `npm test`: 15 passed. `npm run build`: passed.
- Browser preview (`?scenario=lexeme-failure`): status bar shows the failure
  count with Retry; retry clears it; no console errors.

### Commits

- `7d4a67f` merge, `bf97e78` Windows fixes. Not pushed.

## 2026-10-30 - Claude - Phase 1: Anki decks and contextual AI translation

### Goal

Make the cards worth installing the app for: a real Anki deck and the
Russian meaning of each word in the sense used in the book.

### Live Device Checks (Windows, Kindle over MTP)

- Passive probe detected the Kindle in ~0.7 s. Live sync copied and merged
  the library; 831 new lexemes were queued and processed in 83 s with no
  failures. A repeated sync re-queued nothing.
- Sync took 83 s because online cover lookup ran inside it (77 s). Sync now
  copies only Kindle thumbnails; online lookup runs in the background
  without occupying the operation slot. Sync now takes ~3 s.

### Changes

- `anki_export.py`: `.apkg` export via genanki with a fixed note type
  ("Word in context"), GUIDs derived from lexeme ids (re-import updates
  notes), escaped context with the looked-up form highlighted, offline
  WordNet definition labelled with its source, light/dark card CSS.
  Bridge actions `export_apkg` (new words only by default) and `open_path`
  (restricted to the app export folder).
- `llm/`: provider presets (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter,
  LM Studio, Ollama, custom), API keys in the OS keychain via `keyring`
  (env override `KINDLE_CARDS_LLM_API_KEY` for development), an
  OpenAI-compatible client with JSON-schema → json_object → plain fallback,
  and a separate Anthropic SDK client (`claude-opus-5-5` default, low effort,
  structured output, server-side refusal fallback).
- `enrichment.py`: batches with short item numbers, per-batch persistence,
  fatal errors stop the run, timeouts leave words queued, three failed
  batches in a row stop the run. Local presets use batches of 2, a 600 s
  timeout and no SDK retries.
- SQLite schema v3: `enrichments` keyed by `(language, canonical_key)` so
  results survive full catalog replacement; exposed as `lexeme.enrichment`.
- Settings: `llm_provider`, `llm_auto_enrich`; old settings with a custom
  endpoint migrate to the `custom` preset.
- UI: "Перевод через ИИ" settings (provider, key, model list, connection test
  with a built-in sample word), "Перевести N" and "В Anki N" actions, an
  "Открыть в Anki" notice, translation details in the word inspector, and
  completion messages in the status bar.

### Verification

- `pytest`: 67 passed, 1 skipped. `npm test`: 18 passed. `npm run build`: passed.
- Real-library copy: 1,940 cards exported in 3.8 s; WordNet definitions for
  1,921; the looked-up form highlighted in 1,939 contexts.
- Local LM Studio model (9B): 8-word batches timed out; 2-word batches
  translated 6 real words in 71 s with good quality. The prompt now asks
  for dictionary forms (the model returned "казались" for "seem").
- Browser preview: provider selection, key save/replace, connection test
  success and error, translate, export and the open-in-Anki notice work;
  no console errors or horizontal overflow. Screenshots were unavailable
  because the app window was not drawn; checks used the DOM.

### Remaining Risk

- No cloud provider was exercised live (no key on this machine).
- The full Tauri WebView flow and opening `.apkg` in a real Anki were not run.
- The `kindle_app` conda env has an editable install pointing at another
  checkout; scripts run outside the repo import that older package.
- Offline lemmatization still produces some wrong lemmas (e.g. "felt").

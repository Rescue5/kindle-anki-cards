# Kindle Vocabulary Builder

Kindle Vocabulary Builder stores looked-up words in an SQLite database named
`vocab.db`. On Kindle e-ink devices connected by USB it is usually here:

```text
Kindle/system/vocabulary/vocab.db
```

The `system` folder may be hidden. The desktop app can copy this database from a
connected Kindle into a local cache automatically.

## Fresh clone setup

Prerequisites:

- Miniconda or Anaconda.
- WebView2 Runtime on Windows. It is usually already installed on modern
  Windows systems.

Fast setup from the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-dev.ps1
conda activate kindle_app
kindle-vocab-app
```

On macOS/Linux, use:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-dev.sh
conda activate kindle_app
kindle-vocab-app
```

Manual setup, if you do not want to run the script:

```powershell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate kindle_app
python -m pip install -e .
npm install
npm rebuild esbuild
python -c "import nltk; [nltk.download(package, quiet=True) for package in ('wordnet', 'omw-1.4', 'averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng', 'punkt_tab')]"
kindle-vocab-doctor
kindle-vocab-app
```

`environment.yml` installs Python, Node.js, and Rust/Cargo into the conda
environment. If `kindle-vocab-doctor` reports that `cargo` is missing, rerun
`.\scripts\setup-dev.ps1` so the environment is updated from the current file.

If you see this error:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'kindle_vocab_app'
```

the Python package is not installed in the active environment. Run this from the
repository root:

```powershell
conda activate kindle_app
python -m pip uninstall -y kindle-vocab-app
python -m pip install -e .
```

Then verify the package is importable:

```powershell
python -c "import kindle_vocab_app; print(kindle_vocab_app.__file__)"
```

## Runtime diagnostics

Run this when setup succeeds but the app still does not start:

```powershell
conda activate kindle_app
kindle-vocab-doctor
```

The doctor checks Python imports, Node/npm, Cargo/Rust, NLTK resources, Vite, and
Tauri `cargo metadata`.

## Local environment

LLM enrichment is optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` only if you want DS Lab
/ DeepSeek enrichment:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Fill `DSLAB_API_KEY` in `.env`. The local deterministic optimizer and the
desktop UI do not require an API key.

The Kindle database and generated exports are local user data and are excluded
from version control.

## Desktop application

The desktop shell is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Tauri. Python
stays responsible for Kindle database access, deterministic scoring, exports,
and DS Lab / DeepSeek enrichment through the local Tauri bridge.

Logs are written to the local app data directory:

```text
<AppLocalData>/logs/kindle_vocab_app.log
```

The CLI writes logs under the selected output directory:

```text
<output_dir>/logs/kindle_vocab_app.log
```

Set `KINDLE_VOCAB_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to include detailed per-word processing
events.

Features:

- a reading home with the latest Kindle book, new words, recent words, and a
  shortcut into review;
- a Books shelf with per-book words and lookup counts, plus Insights calculated
  from saved Kindle occurrences and dates;
- a Review screen with `Не знаю` / `Трудно` / `Знаю` ratings. Its small local
  schedule is stored in SQLite and remains available after library sync;
- automatically finding a USB-mounted Kindle and loading
  `system/vocabulary/vocab.db` into a local cache;
- manually opening a local `vocab.db` as a fallback;
- selecting a specific book;
- searching across words, contexts, and book metadata;
- previewing words and contexts;
- exporting the current filtered selection to Anki or Quizlet;
- automatically processing previously unseen canonical words in a resumable
  background queue while the application is open;
- storing the authoritative library in `.app-data/kindle_cards.sqlite3`;
- synchronizing accepted words one-way from SQLite to Obsidian without importing
  or overwriting vocabulary from the vault;
- writing `optimized.tsv` plus per-word JSON analysis files as export/audit
  artifacts.

Review uses only accepted words already processed by the local pipeline. It
does not invent translations or reading progress; a card shows a translation
only when one has been saved. The browser preview uses sample words, while the
Tauri app reads the local SQLite library.

The application checks for newly connected devices with a passive probe once a
minute. On
Windows it supports both ordinary drive letters and Kindle devices shown in
Explorer as `This PC > Kindle` through MTP/WPD. It also supports macOS
`/Volumes`, macOS MTP with OpenMTP, and common Linux mount locations under `/media`, `/run/media`, and
`/mnt`.

### Kindle USB on macOS

For a Kindle that appears under `/Volumes`, no extra software is needed. Recent
MTP devices require [OpenMTP](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/), installed in
`/Applications` or `~/Applications`. Apple Silicon and Intel are supported; the
native integration has been verified with OpenMTP 3.3.0 on Apple Silicon.

Close OpenMTP's window/app before syncing in Kindle Cards: only one MTP client
can own the connection. The app uses OpenMTP's Kalam runtime directly, without
mounting the device. Passive checks inspect USB identity only. A synchronization
reads `vocab.db`, available portrait thumbnails, and optional Calibre metadata;
it never writes to the Kindle. The staged SQLite copy is validated before it
replaces the previous local cache. USB timeouts leave the saved library intact.

Book covers are saved locally under `.app-data/covers`. A Kindle thumbnail with
a matching ASIN takes priority; missing covers are searched by book title and
author through [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers).
Vocabulary words and contexts are not sent to the cover service. Cached covers
work offline. Books → **Загрузить обложки** retries failed downloads; an
unmatched book keeps its typographic jacket.

## Optimized Export

The desktop application keeps processed lemmas and its resumable queue in
SQLite so already processed items are not processed again. The standalone CLI
retains `processed_snapshot.json` compatibility. The optimizer writes:

- `optimized.tsv`: same columns as the existing optimized Anki template;
- `word_analysis/*.json`: detailed deterministic scoring audit per new word.

Translations and generated example sentences can be filled by DeepSeek V4 Flash
through the DS Lab OpenAI-compatible API. Put your key into `.env`:

```dotenv
DSLAB_API_KEY=your_key_here
DSLAB_BASE_URL=https://api.dslab.tech/v1
DSLAB_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
```

The scoring uses local deterministic signals: normalization, context-aware
POS tagging when NLTK data is available, WordNet lemmatization and Lesk sense
selection, `wordfreq` Zipf frequencies, simple proper-noun and OCR/noise
checks, phrase detection, and optional book genre preferences from
`kindle_vocab_app/config/processing.toml`.

CLI usage:

```powershell
kindle-vocab-optimize .\vocab.db .\.app-data\optimized
```

To run the local analysis and then fill translations, generated context, and
revised importance with DeepSeek:

```powershell
kindle-vocab-optimize .\vocab.db .\.app-data\optimized --llm
```

To enrich an already generated `optimized.tsv` without reading the Kindle
database again:

```powershell
kindle-vocab-optimize .\.app-data\optimized --enrich-existing-tsv .\.app-data\optimized\optimized.tsv
```

To seed the snapshot from an existing optimized TSV:

```powershell
kindle-vocab-optimize .\vocab.db .\.app-data\optimized --seed-optimized-tsv C:\path\to\kindle_anki_optimized.tsv
```

For best offline WordNet/POS behavior, install NLTK resources once:

```powershell
python -m nltk.downloader -q wordnet omw-1.4 averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng punkt_tab
```

## Export for Anki

```powershell
python .\export_kindle_vocab.py .\vocab.db .\kindle-anki.tsv --format anki --html
```

Import `kindle-anki.tsv` into Anki as tab-separated text. The fields are:

```text
word, stem, context, book_title, authors, language, looked_up_at
```

If you use `--html`, enable "Allow HTML in fields" during import.

## Export for Quizlet

```powershell
python .\export_kindle_vocab.py .\vocab.db .\kindle-quizlet.tsv --format quizlet
```

Quizlet imports term/definition pairs. Kindle's `vocab.db` usually does not
contain dictionary definitions, so this export uses the sentence context plus
book source as the definition side.

## Notes

The relevant Kindle tables are generally:

- `WORDS`: word, stem, language, timestamp
- `LOOKUPS`: lookup event, context sentence, dictionary/book keys, timestamp
- `BOOK_INFO`: title, author, language, ASIN/GUID metadata

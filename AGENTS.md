# Project Context

Kindle Vocabulary Builder is a local desktop app for extracting Kindle Vocabulary
Builder entries from `vocab.db`, previewing them, exporting Anki/Quizlet TSV
files, and running deterministic offline optimization only for words that were
not processed before.

The standard Kindle file is:

```text
Kindle/system/vocabulary/vocab.db
```

On Windows the Kindle may appear as either a mounted drive or an MTP/WPD device
under "This PC > Kindle". The backend already has both paths covered; do not
replace this with drive-letter-only detection.

## Communication Rules

- All agent-to-user communication must be in Russian.
- This includes intermediate questions, confirmations, status updates, summaries,
  and explanations of planned or performed actions.
- If reasoning or source material is in another language, translate it to Russian
  before presenting it to the user.
- Code, commands, identifiers, file paths, and technical terms stay in their
  original form.

## Work Log

- Before inspecting or changing the project, read `WORKLOG.md` from the repository
  root so current decisions and unfinished work are not lost.
- `WORKLOG.md` is append-only. Never rewrite, reorder, or delete previous entries.
- Every agent, including delegated agents, must append its own dated entry for
  each logical batch of work. Record the goal, decisions, changed files, checks,
  failures, remaining risks, and commit hashes when available.
- Do not record API keys, `.env` values, private vocabulary contents, full user
  paths, or other sensitive local data in the work log.
- User instructions about whether delegation is allowed always override the
  orchestration defaults below.

## Agent Orchestration

- For multi-step or parallelizable work, spawn focused subagents rather than
  doing everything in the parent thread.
- Use `AgentSwarm` when the problem can be split into independent lanes with
  distinct, non-overlapping scopes.
- Give each subagent a clear, bounded responsibility and all the context it
  needs; do not duplicate work across agents.
- Prefer read-only exploration agents for investigation, coder agents for
  file changes, and plan agents for architecture decisions.

## Stack

- Desktop shell: Tauri v2.
- UI: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Radix primitives, Framer Motion,
  lucide-react.
- Backend: Python package `kindle_vocab_app`.
- Dev runtime: conda env `kindle_app` with Python, Node.js, and Rust/Cargo from
  `environment.yml`.
- Packaging/config: `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `src-tauri/`.
- Runtime data: local ignored app data, not repository state.

Important scripts and entry points:

```powershell
conda activate kindle_app
npm install
kindle-vocab-doctor
kindle-vocab-app
```

If the documented conda env is absent on a machine, check `conda env list`; older
local workspaces may have used a similarly named Kindle env.

Useful checks:

```powershell
npm run build
python -m compileall kindle_vocab_app
'{"action":"load_demo","payload":{}}' | python -m kindle_vocab_app.tauri_bridge
```

For NLP resources:

```powershell
python -m nltk.downloader -q wordnet omw-1.4 averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng punkt_tab
```

## Architecture Map

- `src/main.tsx` is the main UI. It contains the current workspace screen,
  navigation, status strip, and feature composition.
- `src/features/reading/` contains the reading home, Books, Review, Insights,
  and source-backed reading metrics. Review scores are stored in SQLite.
- `src/lib/backend.ts` is the frontend backend adapter. In Tauri it calls the
  `python_bridge` command; in a plain browser preview it uses mock data.
- `src/types.ts` defines the frontend contract for vocabulary entries,
  processing status, analysis payloads, and API results.
- `src/components/ui/` contains reusable UI primitives. Reuse these before
  adding new one-off controls.
- `src/design/tokens.ts` contains design tokens. UI changes should use these
  tokens instead of ad hoc colors, radii, spacing, or motion values.
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` owns the Tauri `python_bridge(action, payload)` command.
  It launches `python -m kindle_vocab_app.tauri_bridge` and sends JSON through
  stdin/stdout.
- `kindle_vocab_app/app.py` is now a compatibility launcher for the Tauri dev
  app. It is not the real UI. Do not extend an old PySide/Tk-style UI here.
- `kindle_vocab_app/tauri_bridge.py` is the JSON action dispatcher used by the
  frontend.
- `kindle_vocab_app/kindle_device.py` detects and copies the Kindle `vocab.db`
  from mounted drives, Windows MTP/WPD, or macOS MTP.
- `kindle_vocab_app/kindle_mtp.py` runs read-only macOS USB transfers in an
  isolated worker using an installed OpenMTP Kalam runtime. Passive detection
  uses USB identity only; never bind native write operations.
- `kindle_vocab_app/book_covers.py` caches genuine Kindle/Open Library covers.
  Library loads only read this cache; cover requests never send vocabulary.
- `kindle_vocab_app/kindle_db.py` reads the SQLite Kindle database and exports
  filtered entries.
- `kindle_vocab_app/vocab_optimizer.py` performs deterministic offline word
  filtering, scoring, TSV generation, and per-word JSON analysis.
- `kindle_vocab_app/library_repository.py` owns the authoritative local SQLite
  library, schema migration, canonical deduplication, processing queue,
  review schedule, and destination state. The database is
  `.app-data/kindle_cards.sqlite3`.
- `kindle_vocab_app/processing_state.py` stores the legacy snapshot used only by
  standalone optimizer CLI compatibility and one-time SQLite migration.
- `kindle_vocab_app/llm_enricher.py` optionally enriches existing TSV rows
  through the DS Lab/OpenAI-compatible API.
- `kindle_vocab_app/optimizer_cli.py` exposes optimizer and enrichment CLI modes.
- `kindle_vocab_app/settings.py` persists application settings to
  `.app-data/settings.json`.
- `kindle_vocab_app/vocab_cache.py` contains legacy catalog normalization and
  Kindle merge helpers. `.app-data/vocab_cache.json` is migration input, not an
  application source of truth after SQLite has been created.
- `kindle_vocab_app/obsidian_sync.py` reads and writes Spaced Repetition cards in
  Obsidian markdown format, handles priority-file mapping, and backs up the
  Obsidian cards folder before writes.

## Backend Contracts

The Tauri bridge currently supports these actions:

- `scan` / `sync_kindle`: find Kindle, copy `vocab.db` into `.app-data/cache`,
  validate it, merge forms and contexts into SQLite, and enqueue only unseen
  canonical lexemes for processing.
- `load_demo`: return demo vocabulary state without touching a Kindle or cache.
- `download_covers`: read cached Kindle book identifiers, cache local thumbnails
  and exact Open Library matches, and return the refreshed library and counts.
- `load_library` / `load_cached`: return the SQLite library and durable queue
  status without touching Kindle or Obsidian.
- `process_queue`: sequentially analyze the persistent SQLite queue and commit
  every completed lexeme before moving to the next one. The frontend starts it
  automatically while the application is open.
- `process_lexemes` / `optimize`: compatible explicit processing actions for
  selected queued ids; application state still commits to SQLite.
- `export`: write `.app-data/kindle-anki.tsv` or `.app-data/kindle-quizlet.tsv`.
- `load_settings`: return the persisted `AppSettings` dict from
  `.app-data/settings.json` (or defaults if missing).
- `save_settings`: validate and persist a settings dict; returns `{"saved": true}`.
- `load_obsidian`: read-only reconciliation. It checks whether existing SQLite
  lexemes are present in Obsidian but never imports cards, contexts, analyses,
  priorities, or translations into the database.
- `sync_obsidian`: reconcile the live vault, append only eligible
  `ready + accepted + score 3..10` SQLite lexemes, verify the append, and then
  persist destination evidence. Obsidian is never a vocabulary source.
- `load_review` / `rate_review`: load due accepted words and store a local
  interval after `again`, `hard`, or `good` ratings.

Bridge output must be clean JSON on stdout. Do not add debug `print(...)` calls
to stdout in bridge code; use logging/stderr/file logs. The Rust bridge forces
UTF-8 via `PYTHONUTF8=1` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`.

Environment variables used by the bridge and launcher:

- `KINDLE_CARDS_PYTHON`: Python executable used by Tauri.
- `KINDLE_CARDS_WORKSPACE`: workspace root passed to Python.
- `KINDLE_VOCAB_LOG_LEVEL`: logging level, for example `DEBUG`.

## Optimizer And Data Rules

The optimizer is intentionally deterministic and explainable. Preserve that
property unless the user explicitly asks for a different model.

- Process only unseen canonical lexical keys by default.
- Persist desktop state and the resumable queue in SQLite after every lexeme.
- Treat Obsidian as a one-way destination: `Kindle -> SQLite -> Obsidian`.
- Never restore application state from JSON once SQLite migration succeeded.
- Keep `processed_snapshot.json` only for standalone CLI compatibility and
  migration of older installations.
- Preserve existing optimized TSV rows when rerunning incremental processing.
- Write per-word JSON audit files under `word_analysis/`.
- Leave translation/enrichment fields empty when local logic cannot derive them
  correctly.
- Do not fabricate LLM-derived fields.
- Wiktionary/Wiktextract support is currently a placeholder; do not describe it
  as active unless implemented.

The optimized TSV schema is template-driven and was designed to match the
attached `kindle_anki_optimized.tsv` style. Be careful when changing columns:
the app and CLI both depend on stable import/export behavior.

## LLM Enrichment

Optional enrichment uses DS Lab with an OpenAI-compatible client.

Expected `.env` keys:

```text
DSLAB_API_KEY=...
DSLAB_BASE_URL=https://api.dslab.tech/v1
DSLAB_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
```

Also supported: `DSLAB_REASONING_EFFORT`, `DSLAB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

Never commit `.env`, API keys, generated enrichment outputs, or user dictionary
state.

## Runtime Files

Treat these as local/user data and keep them out of commits:

- `.app-data/`
- `.env`
- `vocab.db`
- `kindle-anki.tsv`
- `kindle-quizlet.tsv`
- `kindle_vocab_app.egg-info/`
- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`
- `build/`
- `src-tauri/target/`

The project intentionally tracks `.npmrc` because npm 11 requires explicit
script approval for `esbuild`; without it, fresh installs can leave Vite in a
partially usable state or emit avoidable warnings.

## UI Change Rules

These rules are mandatory for UI work in this repository:

- New features must fit into the existing information architecture. Do not add a
  separate visual language or a detached panel unless the workflow truly needs
  it.
- Reuse existing components from `src/components/ui/` and design tokens from
  `src/design/tokens.ts` before creating new primitives.
- Keep the product visually modern, dense, and work-oriented. Avoid generic
  "AI dashboard" decoration, random gradients, and decorative cards without a
  functional reason.
- Every interactive component needs deliberate hover, pressed, focused,
  disabled, and loading states.
- Every async workflow needs loading, empty, and error states.
- Do not mix business logic into presentational components when a reusable
  helper or backend action is the natural boundary.
- Major UI changes require running the app or build, capturing/reviewing the
  screen, and doing a visual polish pass before considering the work complete.

## Development Notes

- The frontend can be opened in a browser with mock data, but real Kindle
  scanning and filesystem export require Tauri.
- When changing the bridge contract, update TypeScript types, Python dispatcher,
  and Rust error handling together.
- When changing optimizer behavior, add or update a focused CLI/bridge smoke
  check. The most important regression to avoid is reprocessing already-seen
  words.
- Prefer small, explicit configuration files over hidden heuristics. Book genre
  relevance should be configured manually; do not infer genre from title alone.
- Logs are written under local app data for the app and under output-specific
  log directories for CLI runs.
